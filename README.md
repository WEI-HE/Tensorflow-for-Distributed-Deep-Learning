## Distributed Deep Learning with Tensorflow and Cloud ML Engine

#### My code for our (Haohan Wang and I's @hellohaohan) upcoming course with Packt Publishing titled Distributed Deep Learning which covers Data Pipeline, Feature Engineering, Distributed Training and Inference using Tensorflow and Google Cloud AI Tools.

#### TOC and much more code commenting and clarity coming soon.

#### Code uses most-up-to-date Tensorflow patterns including the Datasets API, feature columns, and Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine's core training, hyperparameter tuning, and inference features.
#### Should be released mid-April (Supports Tensorflow 1.7+)
